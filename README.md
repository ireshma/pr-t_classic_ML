# PR-T
## Implementation of the PR-T curves with use cases
It is a supplementary document of our paper entitled "Threshold-wise Evaluation Approach for Binary Classification: an Alternative to ROC and Precision-Recall Curves to Resolve Their Limitations." Here, we present examples of use cases of PR-T in evaluating classical machine learning models and compare the evaluation with the ones of ROC and PR curves.
